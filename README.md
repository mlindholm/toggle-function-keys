# Toggle Function Keys

A simple AppleScript that toggles the `”Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys"` setting found under `System Preferences > Keyboard`. Displays a message to Notification Center telling you which one is active. I use this script via [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) with an assigned keyword.

#### Alfred v2

Just doubble click the `ToggleFunctionKeys.alfredworkflow` file and you are all set. The workflow uses the keyword "fn" by default.

#### Aldred v1

Make a new AppleScript extension and Copy paste the contents of the `ToggleFunctionKeys.scpt` file into the extension.

#### System preferences

Please note that you have to have `”Enable access for assistive devices”` turned on for the application that runs this script.

* 10.9: `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`
* 10.X: `System Preferences > Accessibility`

### Language Support
Because the script invoke apple UI system based on preffered language, now it just supports: 

 * English
 * Chinese
 * German
  
if you have chosen other language, please add corresponding literals to the `langMapList` in the applescript or the applescript in alfred workflow as the right format.
